REFLECT:
1. Yes, this class can be difficult. It compares to other things that I have done before in that it is difficult and I like to challenge myself. It also compares in that it is something that intrigues me also allows me to be a little creative.
2. I'm not really sure but, I do believe that I may not do so well in the ways that others may prefer to have the class ran. Actually, with that response I may have answered the question. I have a feeling that there may be some others who would prefer to have a more structured method way to class and have things more regimented. I do not do so well in a military structured environment.

REVIEW:
1. In the css page I would make a div for the mouseenter event and attach the a hover like function to it where when a mouse it clicked on a link/anchor the text would change size.
2. You would create a page with a login form that takes them to the page that you only want them to see. This could be done with a password or email setting.
3. Ha! still trying to figure this out. I try to do this by centering items with position, padding, margins, etc...
