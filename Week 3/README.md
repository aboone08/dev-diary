REFLECT:
1. So far I believe the easiest for me is CSS. I think this may come easier to me because it seems to follow a format that seems more logical in nature to me. It follows a format or a system that has more of a natural flow. If x does this then y should follow type of deal.
2. JavaScript for sure.
3. I have used w3schools the most. That seems to be the website that I tend to respond to the most or seem to follow and comprehend. I have looked at the links that have been sent out but really plan to read and get into the JavaScript material that was sent out.

REVIEW:
1. getElementByClass and getElementByTagName
2. An event listener would be a click of a mouse and a response would be a change of background color or a response message.
3. When you use the getElementById you are provided with a name that is given to an element. This is different than what is presented when using getElementByClass which is a more specific element of heading, div, section or text type or color.
