Reflect:
1. I like being able code-along in class. It gives me the opportunity to not only see how things are done but to actually try things out myself. By being able to do the codes in class, it allows me to be able to take notes and remember "how it feels" almost how to do codes. If I was just shown how to do the codes then just sent home to do them without actually doing them myself I'm sure I would forgot how to do them myself. I wouldn't retain how to do the codes that were taught earlier in the day.
2. I believe my greatest obstacle at creating a web application would be that of consistency. I have not successfully managed to memorized the codes or sequence that go into how we set up things. I also have trouble being able to get the layout centered. Overall, the hardest thing is trying to get the whole process more streamlined.
3. Read/practice more.
Review:
1. var = variable. this would be used to let the computer or server know that you are getting ready to tell it how to define it.
2.
3. boolean, string, number, array
