Reflect: It is my understanding that as time goes on we will learn how to do some of the additional things that would be nice to see in web applications like moving components and how to utilize buttons in a more interactive and functional manner. It will be nice to not only learn how to do things through trial and error, using my google-fu and seeing what else this course has to offer.
I'm not really sure how I will keep the different languages straight. Hopefully, there will be some unique or useful tricks to the trade that can be given to us.
Review:
Now really sure how I would select a paragraph at the moment but to make the text color light salmon you would set the text color to light salmon by typing the color or by entering the corresponding hexadecimal number.
The difference between inline, internal and external styles is that
In CSS the following styling:
  h1{
    font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
    background-color: chartreuse;
  }
  will make the heading appear in comic sans font with a background color of chartreuse.
