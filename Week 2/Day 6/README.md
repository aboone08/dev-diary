Reflect:
Today was actually one of the better days for me. I think things are actually starting to sink in a little more. I think getting over the sickness helped ; ) If I had to absolutely pick a frustrating thing today, I would say that I wanted to be able to get to my own third page by today but I did not get to it. I did however, did do a a bunch of trial and error before hand and I will take that as a win for myself, again progress was made.
I think that good code conventions are in place because progress is being made
I would describe the box model to someone that has never seen a computer the same way that was described to us in class. I was use the analogy of the body and clothing. The distance that is present from the body and the clothing and the fit (of course in better/greater detail)
Review:
1. Errors that were found today: triple 000, rather than 0O0. replacing : with ;, spelling Errors
2. To make sure that I do not suffer what we did today I will practice paring
3. Padding = the space surrounding the text
4. Margin = the space surrounding the edge of the document
5. a: hover {
  background-color: #FFF;
}
The above allows you to choose which color to assign a link to change to when a cursor is hovering over it.
