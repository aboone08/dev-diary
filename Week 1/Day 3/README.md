Reflect
This best thing for me thus far is being able to see the how much I have learn in the little bit of time we have been in the class. I also found it very beneficial today to hear that many of the other students in the class are having the same issues that I have been and still am having. It was very comforting to hear that I am not alone nor far behind. If I were to make an <h7> tag in a web page I would be creating a heading tag. This tag would be rather small as 1 is registered as the largest. While there is no universal setting nor uniform agreement amongst internet browsers 1, is again, recognized as the largest and the numbers decrease in size as the numbers increase in numerical value. I would describe an html page to a middle school kid as a page that gives you information.

Review: HTML tags
h1 = <h1>heading 1</h1>
h3= <h3>heading 3</h3>
li= list item one
ul= unordered list. these items are bulleted
ol= ordered list, alphabetical or numerical
span= these items are not seen but are important. these items are for emoticons or emojis
div=the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything
em= for emphasis. it is rendered in the form of italics.
strong= for boldness. it is rendered in the form of making the word bold.
p= paragraph tag
