Reflect
I feel pretty good about my first webpage. I look forward to creating more. The most difficult thing would be catching little typos and missteps, in addition to getting the hang of the steps that it takes to make the webpage come to life. At this time I cannot think of any specific questions that I may have.
Review
DOCTYPE = the type of document to be displayed and the difference between <head> and <body> is that <head> refers to the top of the website where the <body>refers to the bulk or middle portion of the website, where the main information or where the eye naturally hits when looking directly at the screen.
